# Portfolio 

## Description
This webpage was created to be a digital portfolio to showcase a selection of bootcamp projects and digital works to prospective employers, or anyone interested in seeing my work. While the webpage currently functions as more of a template, it can be easily updated throughout the bootcamp and beyond.

# Usage
While the webpage currently serves as something of a template into which I will link future projects, the framework of functionality should be visible. The navigation bar is functional and can be used to navigate from one section to another with a click. The section placeholder pictures should have hover properties and anchor tags which can be filled to add projects to the portfolio.
