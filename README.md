# Portfolio 

## Description
This webpage was created to be a digital portfolio to showcase a selection of bootcamp projects and digital works to prospective employers, or anyone interested in seeing my work. While the webpage currently functions as more of a template, it can be easily updated throughout the bootcamp and beyond.

# Usage
While the webpage currently serves as something of a template into which I will link future projects, the framework of functionality should be visible. The navigation bar is functional and can be used to navigate from one section to another with a click. The section placeholder pictures should have hover properties and anchor tags which can be filled to add projects to the portfolio. The webpage also uses media queries to respond to different screen sizes. While the appearance is more or less consistent when rendered on desktop and tablet devices, users will notice a more streamlined layout for mobile devices.
